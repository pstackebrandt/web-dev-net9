# Markdown Best Practices

## Document Structure
- Use a single `# Title` at the top
- Follow with a brief description
- Organize content with hierarchical headings (`##`, `###`)
- Include a TOC for documents longer than 3 sections

## Formatting
- Keep lines under 120 characters for readability
- Break long lines at natural points (after periods, commas, or logical breaks)
- Use **bold** for emphasis, *italics* for terminology
- Code blocks: Triple backticks with language identifier (REQUIRED - prevents MD040)
- Inline code: Single backticks for commands, variables
- Horizontal rules (`---`) only to separate major sections

## Lists
- Use ordered lists (1. 2. 3.) for sequential steps
- Use unordered lists (- or *) for non-sequential items
- Maintain consistent indentation for nested lists

## Links and References
- Use descriptive link text: `[descriptive text](mdc:URL)`
- Prefer relative links for project files
- Group related references at document bottom

## Images
- Include alt text: `![alt text](mdc:image-path)`
- Keep width under 900px for readability
- Store images in dedicated `/assets` or `/images` folder

## Tables
- Use tables for structured data comparisons
- Include header row and alignment indicators
- Keep tables simple; avoid nested tables

## Common Lint Errors to Avoid
- MD040: Always specify a language for fenced code blocks
- MD013: Keep line length under 120 characters
- MD022: Headers must be surrounded by blank lines
- MD023: Headers must start at beginning of line
- MD032: Lists should be surrounded by blank lines
- MD041: First line should be a top-level header
