    _ViewStart.cshtml is executed at the beginning of every view's rendering
    It allows setting common view aspects without repeating code in each view
    The Layout property defines the shared layout template for all views
    Changes here affect all views in this directory and subdirectories

@{
    // Set the default layout for all views in this directory and subdirectories
    Layout = "_Layout";

    // Set a default title for all views in this directory and subdirectories
