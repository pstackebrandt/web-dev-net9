# Configuration Refactoring Implementation Plan (COMPLETED)

This plan has been fully implemented and can be deleted.

All tasks from the implementation plan have been completed:

1. ✅ Updated `NorthwindContext.cs` to support environment-specific configuration and user secrets
2. ✅ Updated `NorthwindContextExtensions.cs` to use strongly-typed settings
3. ✅ Added comprehensive unit tests for configuration loading
4. ✅ Added required NuGet packages for user secrets and configuration binding
5. ✅ Fixed tests to use in-memory configuration instead of physical files

The changes follow all the principles outlined in the original implementation approach:
- Minimal changes that maintain compatibility with book examples
- Reuse of existing code
- Improved error handling
- Environment awareness
- Strong typing
- Security through user secrets
