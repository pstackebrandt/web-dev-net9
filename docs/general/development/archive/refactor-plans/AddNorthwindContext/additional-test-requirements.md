# Additional Test Requirements for AddNorthwindContext Refactoring

This document outlines the additional test requirements identified during the review of existing test coverage for the `AddNorthwindContext` extension method refactoring.

## Current Test Coverage

The current test coverage for `AddNorthwindContext` is primarily in `ConfigurationLoadingTests.cs` and includes:

1. **`NorthwindContextExtensions_UsesConnectionSettingsFromConfiguration`**
   - Verifies that configuration values are correctly passed to the database context
   - Tests that connection settings like server name, database name, timeout, and credentials are properly applied

2. **`Missing_Credentials_ThrowsInformativeException`**
   - Verifies appropriate error handling for missing credentials
   - Tests that an informative exception is thrown when database credentials are missing

## Test Gaps Identified

The following gaps were identified in the existing test coverage:

1. **No tests for the direct connection string parameter overload**
   - The extension method accepts an optional connection string parameter, but there are no dedicated tests for this path

2. **No tests for connection string building logic**
   - No tests specifically verifying the construction of the connection string from individual settings

3. **No tests for specific database provider options**
   - No verification of the SQL Server provider options being set correctly

4. **No tests for transient service registration**
   - No verification that the context is registered with the correct lifetime (transient)

[Full test requirements content was here - truncated for brevity]

## Implementation Plan

1. Create a new test class `NorthwindContextExtensionsTests.cs` in the same namespace as the existing tests
2. Implement the tests outlined above
3. Run tests after each implementation step to ensure backward compatibility
4. Update existing tests to use the new overload once it's stable

## Expected Outcomes

- Comprehensive test coverage for both old and new method overloads
- Verification that both implementations produce identical results
- Confirmation of correct error handling for edge cases
- Validation of service registration with proper lifetime
