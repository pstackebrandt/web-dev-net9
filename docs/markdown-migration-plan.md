# Markdown Files Migration Plan

This document outlines the specific actions taken to organize all documentation files according to the structure defined in the Documentation Organization Plan.

## COMPLETED CONSOLIDATION

## Initial Migration Actions (Completed)

## Consolidation Phase (Completed)

We identified an issue with having documentation at both the repository root (`docs/`) and in the MatureWeb solution folder (`code/MatureWeb/docs/`). Since MatureWeb is the only solution in the repository, this created unnecessary redundancy.

A **Documentation Consolidation Plan** was created to address this issue and has now been fully implemented:

### 1. Create Testing Directory (Completed)

```powershell
# Create testing directory in general/development
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "docs/general/development/testing" -Force
```
✅ Completed

### 2. Move Configuration Files (Completed)

```powershell
# The following files were moved to the root docs directory:
# From: code/MatureWeb/docs/configuration/configuration-best-practices.md
# To:   docs/general/development/configuration-best-practices.md

# From: code/MatureWeb/docs/configuration/user-secrets-setup.md
# To:   docs/general/development/user-secrets-setup.md
```
✅ Completed

### 3. Move Testing Files (Completed)

```powershell
# The following files were moved to the root docs directory:
# From: code/MatureWeb/docs/testing/test-best-practices.md
# To:   docs/general/development/testing/test-best-practices.md

# From: code/MatureWeb/docs/testing/test-configuration-guide.md
# To:   docs/general/development/testing/test-configuration-guide.md

# From: code/MatureWeb/docs/testing/test-environment-setup.md
# To:   docs/general/development/testing/test-environment-setup.md

# From: code/MatureWeb/docs/testing/test-naming-conventions.md
# To:   docs/general/development/testing/test-naming-conventions.md

# From: code/MatureWeb/docs/testing/TestStructure.md
# To:   docs/general/development/testing/TestStructure.md
```
✅ Completed

### 4. Clean Up Empty Directories (Completed)

```powershell
# Remove empty directories after moving files
Remove-Item -Path "code/MatureWeb/docs/configuration" -Force
Remove-Item -Path "code/MatureWeb/docs/testing" -Force
Remove-Item -Path "code/MatureWeb/docs/features" -Force
Remove-Item -Path "code/MatureWeb/docs" -Force
```
✅ Completed
