# Infrastructure Project Task Management Transfer Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the complete plan for transferring the advanced task management system from the web-dev-net9 project to the infrastructure project at `C:\Users\peter\code\infrastructure\config-pc\WingetWithCursor`.

## Target Project Analysis

**Current State:**
- Single `TASKS.md` file with basic format
- Task IDs: CC1-CC10, TCH1-TCH5, CCR1-CCR6, GBC1-GBC3, PA1-PA5
- Categories: Claude Code Setup, Terminal Call Handling, Re-Testing, Git Bash Backend, Project Analysis
- 68 lines total with examples and notes sections

**Target State:**
- Multi-file task management system in `tasks/` folder
- Structured task format with priorities (P1-P4) and sizes (S/M/L/XL)
- AI collaboration workflow support
- Enhanced CLAUDE.md with management guidance

## Transfer Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Create tasks/ Folder Structure

**Target Location:** `C:\Users\peter\code\infrastructure\config-pc\WingetWithCursor\tasks\`

**Files to Create:**
1. **TASKS.md** - Main task tracking with migrated content
2. **ai-handoff-guide.md** - Copy from source (universal content)
3. **task-workflow.md** - Copy from source (universal content)
4. **session-state-template.md** - Infrastructure-adapted template

### Phase 2: Task Migration Mapping

**Priority Assignment Strategy:**
- **P1 (Critical)**: Core functionality needed for project success
- **P2 (High)**: Important workflow improvements and validations
- **P3 (Medium)**: Optimizations and enhancements
- **P4 (Low)**: Future considerations

**Task Mapping:**

| Original ID | New ID | Priority | Size | Category | Rationale |
|-------------|--------|----------|------|----------|-----------|
| CC1-CC5 | T001-T005 | P1 | S | Infrastructure & Setup | Core setup completed |
| CC6-CC10 | T006-T010 | P2 | S-M | Development Tools | Workflow optimization |
| TCH1-TCH5 | T011-T015 | P2 | S-M | Terminal Handling | Critical for development |
| CCR1-CCR3 | T016-T018 | P1 | S | Validation | Completed validation |
| CCR4-CCR6 | T019-T021 | P2 | S-M | Testing | Extended testing |
| GBC1-GBC3 | T022-T024 | P3 | S | Configuration | Performance optimization |
| PA1-PA5 | T025-T029 | P2-P3 | M-L | Project Analysis | Core project goals |

### Phase 3: Content Adaptation for Infrastructure Context

**Technology Adaptations:**
- PowerShell/Windows focus (vs .NET commands)
- Infrastructure/configuration patterns (vs web development)
- Claude Code integration specifics
- Terminal handling protocols preservation

**Task Categories for Infrastructure Project:**
1. **Infrastructure & Setup** (Critical foundation)
2. **Development Tools & Workflow** (Claude Code, Cursor integration)
3. **Terminal Handling & Validation** (Core operational issues)
4. **Configuration & Optimization** (Performance improvements)
5. **Project Analysis & Goals** (Primary objectives)

### Phase 4: CLAUDE.md Updates

**Infrastructure Project CLAUDE.md Additions:**
```markdown
## Task Management

**Project Tasks**: All project tasks are tracked in `tasks\TASKS.md` using a structured format with priorities, sizes, and AI assignments. Always reference this file for current work items and project status.

**Task Format**: `- [ ] **P[1-4]** T[###] [S/M/L/XL] [AI] Description`
- **Priority**: P1 (Critical) → P4 (Low)
- **Size**: S(mall), M(edium), L(arge), XL (epic)
- **AI Assignment**: Claude, Cursor, VS, Other

## Documentation Standards

**Priority Overrides**:
- **Always use TOCs** for architecture documents, audits, and investigation reports
- **Always use TOCs** for any document with 3+ sections (strict enforcement)

## Security Rules

### CRITICAL Security Rules (Never Violate)
- **Never write real passwords, API keys, or credentials in documentation** (even as examples)
- **Never commit sensitive information to source control**
- **Never expose production secrets in logs or error messages**

### HIGH Priority Security Practices
- Use placeholder text for sensitive examples: `"your_password"`, `"YourApiKey"`
- Use environment variables for API keys and secrets
- Follow secure configuration practices in documentation
```

**Source Project CLAUDE.md Addition:**
```markdown
## Using Transferred Task Management Assets

This project's task management system has been designed for reuse across multiple projects. The `tasks/` folder contains universal workflow guides and templates.

### Multi-File System Usage
- **TASKS.md**: Main task tracking with priority/size indicators
- **ai-handoff-guide.md**: Protocols for multi-assistant collaboration
- **task-workflow.md**: Task lifecycle management processes
- **session-state-*.md**: Session tracking templates

### AI Collaboration Patterns
- Use **AI Assignment** field to coordinate between Claude, Cursor, and other assistants
- Reference session state files for complex investigations
- Follow handoff protocols when passing tasks between AIs

### Task Lifecycle Examples
```markdown
## Active Tasks
- [ ] **P1** T003 [M] [Claude] Implement user authentication [Details](./session-state-T003.md)

## Completed Tasks  
- [x] ✅ **P1** T002 [S] [Claude] Setup project documentation (2025-01-26)
```
```

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Backup Current State
```bash
# Create backup of current infrastructure project state
cp "C:\Users\peter\code\infrastructure\config-pc\WingetWithCursor\TASKS.md" "C:\Users\peter\code\infrastructure\config-pc\WingetWithCursor\TASKS.md.backup"
```

### Step 2: Create tasks/ Folder
```bash
mkdir "C:\Users\peter\code\infrastructure\config-pc\WingetWithCursor\tasks"
```

### Step 3: Copy Universal Files
- Copy `ai-handoff-guide.md` and `task-workflow.md` unchanged
- Create infrastructure-specific `session-state-template.md`

### Step 4: Create New TASKS.md
- Migrate existing tasks using mapping table above
- Organize into new category structure
- Add task management guidelines section
- Preserve all existing task content and completion status

### Step 5: Update CLAUDE.md Files
- Add task management sections to infrastructure project
- Add usage documentation to source project
- Ensure file paths and references are correct

### Step 6: Validation
- Verify all original task content is preserved
- Test file paths and references
- Confirm task management workflow functions
- Validate both CLAUDE.md files are enhanced properly

## Quality Assurance Checklist

**Pre-Transfer:**
- [ ] Current infrastructure TASKS.md backed up
- [ ] Source project task files ready for copying
- [ ] Task mapping table validated

**Post-Transfer:**
- [ ] All original tasks preserved with new format
- [ ] Task categories appropriate for infrastructure context
- [ ] File paths and references work correctly
- [ ] CLAUDE.md files enhanced with new sections
- [ ] No source project-specific content in target

**Validation Tests:**
- [ ] Can create new tasks using the format
- [ ] Task priorities and sizes make sense for infrastructure work
- [ ] AI collaboration workflow is clear
- [ ] Session tracking template is infrastructure-appropriate

## Risk Mitigation

**Primary Risks:**
1. **Content Loss**: Original task information could be lost during migration
   - *Mitigation*: Create backup, validate preservation of all content
   
2. **Context Mismatch**: Infrastructure tasks don't fit web development categories
   - *Mitigation*: Adapt categories and examples for infrastructure context
   
3. **Workflow Disruption**: New system too complex for infrastructure project needs
   - *Mitigation*: Preserve existing workflow patterns, enhance incrementally

**Rollback Plan:**
If issues arise, restore from backup and adjust approach:
```bash
cp "C:\Users\peter\code\infrastructure\config-pc\WingetWithCursor\TASKS.md.backup" "C:\Users\peter\code\infrastructure\config-pc\WingetWithCursor\TASKS.md"
```
