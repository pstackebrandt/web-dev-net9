# T001 Database Connection Issues - Session State

**Task**: Fix Database Connection Issues (5 failing unit tests)  
**Priority**: P1 (Critical)  
**Status**: Active - Database connectivity investigation

## Current Session Progress

### Session Summary
- **Started**: 2025-07-22
- **Focus**: Investigating SQL Server connection errors in unit tests
- **Approach**: Systematic verification of Docker containers and database connectivity

### Key Decisions Made
- **Container Strategy**: Manual Docker container setup (not Aspire-managed)
- **Container Configuration**: Using Price's recommended setup with `--cap-add SYS_PTRACE`
- **Database Installation**: Using SQL script from Price's book to install Northwind database

### Investigation Progress

#### ‚úÖ Completed Steps
- [x] Pulled Azure SQL Edge image (`docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/azure-sql-edge:latest`)
- [x] Created and started container with proper configuration
- [x] Updated sql-edge-container-management.md with setup details
- [x] Verified container is running (`azuresqledge` - Up 39 minutes, port 1433 mapped)
- [x] Attempted Northwind database installation (PowerShell approach successful)
- [x] Resolved SQL script execution errors using VS Code SQL Server extension
- [x] Successfully installed Northwind database via VS Code extension
- [x] Updated documentation with database recreation process
- [ ] Verify database installation and connectivity
- [ ] Run and fix failing unit tests

#### üîÑ Current Step
Ready to test database connectivity and run unit tests

#### üìã Next Steps Queue
1. Check Docker container status (`docker ps`)
2. Verify SQL Edge container is running with Northwind database
3. Test basic database connectivity
4. Run specific failing unit tests to identify patterns
5. Document findings and fixes

### Findings & Notes

#### Docker Container Status
- ‚úÖ Container `azuresqledge` running successfully (Up 39+ minutes)
- ‚úÖ Port mapping working: 0.0.0.0:1433->1433/tcp  
- ‚úÖ Standard SQL Server port accessible from localhost

#### Database Connectivity Tests  
- ‚úÖ PowerShell approach initially had issues with binary data in SQL script
- ‚úÖ VS Code SQL Server extension method successful for database installation
- ‚úÖ Database connection established and Northwind database fully installed
- ‚úÖ All tables created (Categories, Products, Orders, etc.) with sample data

#### Unit Test Failure Analysis
*Pending - need to complete database setup first*

#### Configuration Validation
- ‚úÖ Container accepts SA password and establishes connection
- ‚ùå SQL script has data encoding/corruption issues

### Solutions Applied
*(Track what fixes were implemented)*

### Open Questions
*(Things that need clarification or investigation)*
